        NanoPond is copyrighted by Pieter Pareit (pieter.pareit@gmail.com). The

        NanoPond runs a virtual machine in which \'life\' can develop. This virtual
        machine is a port of a java program by Thomas Abeel, who in turn based his
        virtual machine on the c code of Adam Ierymenko. NanoPond was used in a
        Computational Intelligence course at the university of Ghent.\n\n
